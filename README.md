**Approach Used for Algorithm/Design Generation:**
The algorithm/design was developed using a systematic approach that involved:

Understanding the problem statement and objectives.
Analyzing the requirements and constraints.
Selecting appropriate algorithmic techniques, such as pseudocode for latency and bandwidth measurement and Reinforcement Learning for optimization.
Implementing the algorithm in Python, adhering to best practices and coding standards.
The approach used to generate the algorithm/design involves a combination of problem analysis, algorithm selection, and iterative refinement. Initially, we thoroughly analyzed the problem statement, understanding the requirements, constraints, and objectives of optimizing the Network on Chip (NOC) design. Given the complexity of the problem, we then identified suitable algorithmic approaches, ultimately selecting Deep Q-Network (DQN) due to its ability to handle continuous state spaces and complex interactions between actions and rewards.
Next, we broke down the problem into smaller, more manageable components, defining the states, actions, and rewards for the RL framework. This involved careful consideration of NOC parameters such as buffer sizes, arbiter weights, and throttling, as well as performance metrics like latency, bandwidth, and power consumption.
With the framework in place, we proceeded to design the algorithm, starting with pseudocode for measuring latency and bandwidth efficiently from simulation data. We then developed the DQN algorithm, specifying the neural network architecture, experience replay buffer, and training process. Throughout this process, we iteratively refined the design based on feedback and evaluation, ensuring that the algorithm effectively balanced performance metrics while minimizing power consumption and resource waste.
Overall, the approach involved a systematic and iterative process of problem analysis, algorithm selection, and refinement to generate an effective algorithm/design for optimizing the NOC.
